# ZBot Simple Bot That Auto-Checks And Launches Products When they are in stock(GPU Bot, Console Bot etc)
An Simple Auto Bot Checker to help purchase the latest GPU and Consoles without hassle. Since everybody's doing it, why not level the playing field?. Very simple to use than most bots barely requires a single setup, its also free and opensource. Currently working on it but i will release it soon once i figure out some bugs.

How it works:
Uses simple webClient to see whether a site is in stock for a certain GPU, or Console.
